# RayzelsGBA — Deluxe v4.4 (Auto Fit)

- **Auto Fit** scales the canvas to the largest integer multiple of **240×160** that fits your window/panel, and updates on resize.  
- Still **Safari‑proof** (local‑first `./gba.min.js`), with CDN fallback.
- Deluxe polish: pause overlay (Esc), FPS/perf, recents, cheats, glass UI, haptics.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure a real **`gba.min.js`** is next to `index.html` (copy from your v4.2 folder or download from unpkg/jsDelivr).
2. Upload everything to your GitHub repo root.
3. GitHub **Settings → Pages** → Source: `main` (root).
4. Open your Pages link → **Browse ROM** → pick a legal `.gba`.

## Optional fixed scales
Use the Scale dropdown to pick 2×–10× instead of Auto.

## Legal
Use only lawful ROMs (homebrew or backups you own). Emulators are legal; copyrighted ROM distribution is not.
